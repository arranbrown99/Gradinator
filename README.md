# Gradinator

A django web app designed as part of a web app development course. 
Users can add their enrolled courses and their marks for the coursework that they acheived 
and the web app predicts what result the student would need to get to acheive various grades in that course.
AJAX is used to dynamically show the enrolled courses without refreshing the page.
